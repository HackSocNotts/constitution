\begin{clause}
  Presidential candidates may only be drawn from those who have attended at least 2 hackathons, 2 workshops, and 5 total regular HackSoc events, as long as at least one candidate runs with these credentials. If no candidates have attended at least 2 hackathons, 2 workshops, and 5 regular events, the restriction no longer applies, and any member may run.
