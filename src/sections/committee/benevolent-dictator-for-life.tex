\begin{clause}
  Presidents gain a ``Benevolent Dictator for Life'' (a common title in Programming subculture, often used to refer to the creator of a programming language, which although giving no formal power, implies respect of their opinion and expertise) status upon the end of their term. In this capacity they may act as an advisor to their successor and ensure the smooth conclusion of provisions that may not have been successfully completed in the length of their term; for example, a president begins to oversee a large sponsorship deal, but the discussions take more than a year and it is preferable for this member to continue oversight of the deal after their presidential term is up.
