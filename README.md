# HackSoc Constitution

This repository is to keep track of all changes to the HackSoc Constitution.

You can view the latest version of the constitution in [releases](https://github.com/HackSocNotts/constitution/releases)

## Submitting Amendments
When HackSoc holds an EGM or AGM, members may propose amendments. They should do so in the [official amendments form](https://hacksoc.net/amend) as well as submitting a pull request here.

When adding/changing files please ensure that you respect the way the tree is sorted.
 - Don't edit `main.tex` unless you're adding/removing a section
 - Only ever `input` a `src/[section]/index.tex` file in main
 - Every clause/paragraph should be its own file
 - Where a clause has multiple sections (e.g. officers), each clear section should have its own file in a subfolder

If you fail to comply with these guidelines your branch will be edited accordingly.
